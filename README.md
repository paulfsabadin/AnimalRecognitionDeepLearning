# AnimalRecognitionDeepLearning

## Description:
This project is intended to maintain base code for convolutional neural network deep learning for recognition of animals in images. It is written in Python and hosted in a Jupyter Notebook to help with readability and understandability.

## Installation:
Python 2x, Jupyter Notebook, and a base installation of Anaconda 2 is required.

## Usage:
Simply launch a Jupyter Notebook and execute the .ipyjn file 

## Credits:
Based on Udacity convolutional neural network pedagogical project.
